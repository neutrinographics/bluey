# Write-integrity stress test — chunked, both write types, byte-exact (I344)

- **Date:** 2026-06-03
- **Status:** Approved (design)
- **Backlog:** [I344](../../../docs/backlog/I344-write-integrity-stress-test.md)
- **Guards:** [I343](../../../docs/backlog/I343-ios-to-android-multi-chunk-writenoresponse-loses-2-bytes-per-frame.md) (max-write truncation, fixed by the 512-octet clamp)

## Purpose

A repeatable on-device regression guard proving that a central writes **byte-exact**
to a peripheral — especially at / above `maxWritePayload`, the size that silently
truncated in I343. It must reproduce the real-world failure (a logical payload
larger than one write, **chunked** by the consumer) and verify the reassembled
bytes match exactly, on **both** write types.

This is example-app test tooling (the `stress_tests` feature), not a bluey-library
change.

## Decision: extend the existing `mtuProbe` stress test

`mtuProbe` ("MTU negotiation and large-payload writes") already has the
scaffolding: the `requestedMtu` + `payloadBytes` config, the
`requestMtu → write → read-back → verify` round, and the result panel. We extend
it rather than add a new variant — it is the semantically correct home.

### What changes in `mtuProbe` (`stress_test_runner.dart`)

Replace the single-write round with a **chunked byte-exact transfer**, run for
**both write types**:

1. (Android-central only, unchanged) `requestMtu(config.requestedMtu)`.
2. Query the real limit: `chunk = await connection.maxWritePayload(withResponse: …)`.
   `config.payloadBytes` is the **logical** transfer size and may exceed `chunk`
   (e.g. 600) — that is the point.
3. Generate a deterministic payload of `payloadBytes` (`byte[i] = i & 0xff`).
4. **Chunk** it into ⌈payloadBytes / chunk⌉ writes; send each in order as a
   `TransferChunk` command (below), using the round's write type.
5. **Read back** the server's reassembled buffer (`stressChar.read()`).
6. **Byte-compare** read-back vs the regenerated pattern → verdict.
7. Run steps 2–6 **twice**: once `withResponse: false` (the I343 path), once
   `withResponse: true` (settles the unverified "with-response is capped at 512"
   question empirically). Record each as its own labelled outcome.

### Protocol: one new command + server reassembly (`stress_protocol.dart` + `stress_service_handler.dart`)

Add `TransferChunk` (next free opcode `0x07`):
- Wire: `[0x07][seq u16 LE][totalLen u32 LE][data…]`.
- Server (`StressServiceHandler`): maintains a per-instance reassembly buffer.
  - `seq == 0` resets the buffer and records `totalLen`.
  - Each chunk appends `data` in `seq` order. Out-of-order / gap / overflow →
    record a fault (the next read returns a sentinel so the verdict fails).
  - When the buffer reaches `totalLen`, set `_lastEcho = buffer` (reuse the
    existing `onRead` path, which already returns `_lastEcho`).
- `ResetCommand` also clears the reassembly buffer (extend the existing reset).

Chunks are WriteNoResponse-capable: `onWrite` already handles `responseNeeded
== false`. The control/read-back path (`read`) is reliable, so only the
chunked-write leg under test uses the configured write type.

### Verdict: pure, unit-testable

A pure function `evaluateTransfer({required int expectedLen, required Uint8List readBack})`
→ `TransferVerdict` (`ok` | `{firstDivergenceOffset, expectedByte, gotByte, expectedLen, gotLen}`).
A truncated max-size chunk → read-back is short → first-divergence at the
truncation point → FAIL. The BLE round-trip is the only on-device part; the
verdict is plain Dart.

### Result surfacing

Reuse the existing stress result model/panel: per-pass success/failure +, on
failure, the divergence detail (`offset N: expected 0xNN got 0xMM, len A vs B`)
and the write type. The MTU-probe round currently records 3 cycles; keep that
shape (e.g. cycles × {withResponse, withoutResponse}).

## Testing

- **Unit tests** (`bluey/example/.../stress_tests/.../*_test.dart` style, or the
  example's existing test dir) for:
  - `evaluateTransfer`: exact match → ok; truncated (short readBack) → divergence
    at the cut; wrong byte mid-stream → divergence offset; empty → handled.
  - `TransferChunk` encode/decode round-trips; server reassembly across N chunks
    yields the original; out-of-order/gap → fault.
- **On-device**: run the extended `mtuProbe` (iPhone central ↔ Pixel peripheral)
  with `payloadBytes` set above `maxWritePayload` (e.g. 600) → PASS on `main`
  (the 512 clamp is in); temporarily un-clamp `WritePayloadLimit` → the
  WriteNoResponse pass FAILs with a tail divergence (proves the guard bites).

## Out of scope

- No bluey-library changes (example-app tooling only).
- No automatic CI hook — it needs two real devices; it's a manual dogfood guard.
- The drop-vs-coalesce *classification* from the original I344 sketch is dropped
  (the cause is known; byte-exact compare is sufficient).

## Implementation footprint

- `bluey/example/lib/shared/stress_protocol.dart` — `TransferChunk` command (0x07).
- `bluey/example/lib/features/server/infrastructure/stress_service_handler.dart` —
  reassembly buffer + `TransferChunk` case + reset extension.
- `bluey/example/lib/features/stress_tests/infrastructure/stress_test_runner.dart` —
  rewrite the `mtuProbe` round: chunked transfer, both write types, byte-exact
  verify via `evaluateTransfer`.
- `bluey/example/lib/features/stress_tests/.../` — the pure `evaluateTransfer`
  + `TransferVerdict` (new small file) and its unit tests.
- `bluey/example/lib/features/stress_tests/.../stress_test_help_content.dart` —
  update the `mtuProbe` help text to describe the byte-exact chunked check.
